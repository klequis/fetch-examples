# fetch-examples

This project contains 3 'fetch' examples.

Note that fetch is a promise so you may need to do a little reading-up on
promises to follow the code.

/app/index.js is where the example is called from. You can comment-out
one or more of them to focus on the example you are interested in.

The examples are in /app/components.

Most files in other directories are not being used and you can ignore.
